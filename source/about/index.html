<p>
We’re a small team of talented and experienced Android engineers, who gathered together to do something meaningful and notable in the world of Android development.
</p>

<p>
We have a strong believe that nowadays big companies/corporations with huge headcount, complicated processes, long and complex chain of responsibilities and very slow decision-making processes are very inefficient. From the other hand, this situation gives opportunities for small, but very efficient teams of talented engineers to make a big impact. Additionally, we believe in synergy when the “energy” generated by a good team can be higher than the sum of “energies” generated by each contributor of this team alone.

<p>
What’s why we decided to create our team of great Android engineers. In parallel with app development, we also decided to do blogging here to share our knowledge with the community. Your feedback of any kind is highly appreciated!
