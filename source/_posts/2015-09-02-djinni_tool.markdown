Just discovered very interesting tool written by Dropbox - `https://github.com/dropbox/djinni'

It allow us to generate interfaces using some simple interface definition language(IDL) to implement something in using NDK. 
Just define your interface, run the tool and it generates you JNI wrappers and C++ interfases to implement.
Awesome!
